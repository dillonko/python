	print("So go ahead and copy the client.py module into your main folder.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("Now try again. Type runProg(\"client.py\")")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("It will then ask you for a Host")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("You need to enter which host is sending the data.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("We know we want to connect to localhost")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("So we need to type 'localhost'")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("It will now ask us which port we want.")
	print("You need to enter the port that the host is sending the data over.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("We know the port our host is sending data over is 50123")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("So we need to type '50123'")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("Now it will ask us for a time.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("If you enter 5 it will wait for a packet to be sent through the same port and \nhost and then recieve 5 packets.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("Now we should see the message broadcasted by our server being recieved in the \nclient.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("Once the Broadcast Server has finished broadcasting, it will return to the \nshell.")
	cont = raw_input("")
	print("Once the client has finished recieving data, it will return to the shell.")
	print("Look at the readme for more information.")
